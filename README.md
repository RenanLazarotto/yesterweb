# What a weird hill we are!
So, lets talk about this project. If you, by any means, strumbled on this project by chance, this is my 'bring-back-the-90's' site. Back when the internet was simple, just some horrible-looking sites, filled with sparkling gifs and tables everywhere. We have evolved to the point that the web now is a bit of content buried on the middle of lots of ads. Lets change that.

## How did I get there?
Well, it all starts with [this article](https://localghost.dev/blog/building-a-website-like-it-s-1999-in-2022/). Somewhere on it, there is a link to [this page](https://sotb22-webring.neocities.org/), which in turn is hosted by [NeoCities](https://neocities.org/). NeoCities looks a lot like GeoSites, that where a thing back in the late 90's and early 2000's. There, people could host their crappy static sites for free. 

I wish I had a GeoSites back when I was younger, so when it was announced that it was going to shut down, I was sad - I was just taking interest on programming and having a website to learn something I was wishing to do.

NeoSites has a site gallery and the very first site I landed on was [sadgrl.online](https://sadgrl.online), and from there too many stuff happened. I've learned about how there are people trying to bring back the 90's web back by making it simple and this is my attempt to do it. 

## Nice, now what about the code?
Well, the idea is to make a simple web, but I really can't stand making everything _by hand_. I'm a web developer, after all, so I know a thing or two - and doing everything by hand isn't on my things-I-like-to-do list.

So, this project is being made with Svelte, a framework I have a nice relationship with and that can output static files, just what NeoCities is made for.

And thats pretty much about it.
