## 19/01/2019 - Getting somewhere
After a while, I changed some things on the site layout, but most of the changes where on the source code. The most notable change is the new Android section, where I'll talk about apps and ROMs, and the subtitles (that light-blue thingy on this section header) that where inside the section as an italic text and now have their own space.

Also, the layout now is a little wider in order to not waste so much space. 

Next things to do: 

- implement a mobile version;
- once again, review all the CSS because I'm still not happy with it;
- start to think about a new theme, because I'm already bored of this one;
- rethink the font pairings another time (its the 75th time I rethink it, and thats just today);
- stop being a lazy sloth and start to learn Vue;
- play FreeFire for another 6 hours straight.
