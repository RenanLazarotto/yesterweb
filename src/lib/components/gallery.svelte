            <h2>RollerCoaster Tycoon</h2>
            <p>One of the first games I played on PC when I was a kid.</p>
            <p>
                I remember spending hours on it, trying to make the best park
                possible withouth using trainers.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was also this game that started my addiction to modding
                stuff.

                This was my first contact with racing games. It was dead simple,
                graphics weren't its strongest point and, to be honest, it was
                somewhat repetitive.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is, to this day, the best racing game ever made. None of its
                drawbacks are actually something that demerit it. Its simplicity
                is what makes it so enjoyable, its repetitiveness are just a
                key-point on how its carreer develops.
            </p>
            <p>You simply can't go wrong with this game.</p>

                I could've just left the cover and the title here and it would
                be self-explanatory, but I have to say something of this
                legendary game.
            </p>
            <p>
                I could bet that you can ask anyone that grew up in the 90's and
                had the chance to own a SNES console if they had played SMW and
                the odds are that I'd win.
            </p>
            <p>
                This game was EPIC. Great levels, annoying bosses, secrets
                everywhere, many ways to finish the same level, bugs that people
                later found out that simply won't happen on modern games... the
                list goes on.

                If the first one had some points on it where you would want to
                throw your cartridge into a fire and watch it slowly melts into
                an irrecoverable goo of plastic and silicon, this one takes this
                a whole olympic pool length further.
            </p>
            <p>
                The baby Mario is annoying. It cries for 10 (or it was 15?)
                seconds and bam, level over. Sometimes all you wish is that his
                will show up and take him with them.
            </p>
            <p>
                But obviously that won't happen and you're left with one of the
                most good-looking games the SNES has seen. Game mechanics that I
                had never seen before and I really don't recall seeing in modern
                games.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another one of those games that you spend hours trying to find
                everything because there is just so much stuff to be found...

                AWWW YISSS, if Super Mario World 1 and 2 where good, this one is
                a masterpiece! 3D graphics on a 16-bit console? AMAZING!
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, it might not be a true 3D render, but it looks awesome.
                Its one of those platformers that you keep playing even after
                finishing it the first time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also guess that this game was the first one to test how greedy
                I was/am. Some of the bananas where placed on locations that you
                had to had the perfect timing to get them, otherwise you'd die.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, secrets. Secrets everywhere. It seems that secrets on
                platformers are a thing, and boy some of those are HARD.

                Grab everything that made Donkey Kong Country good. Double that.
                Now triple that. Got it?
            </p>
            <p>
                The gameplay was refined and the controls where so good that
                this was the first game that I did a speed run. The characters
                are somewhat charismatic to the point that you <span class="highlight">have</span> to keep
                them both, otherwise they'll be sad.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember the thing about secrets on platformers? DKC2 takes it
                to a whole new level with the DK coins and the Banana Coins.

            <p>
                There is absolutely no way to go wrong with DK series, but this
                one is my personal favourite.

                Are you tired of Donkey Kong? Because there is MORE Donkey Kong!
                The three Donkey Kong Country games are so good that I simply
                cannot talk about them as one, I have to praise them one by one.

                They somehow managed to make this game EVEN PRETTIER than the
                first two. They added Genie-like caves where you free birds.
                There are bonus that give you Bonus coins. There are secrets.
                Lots of them.
            </p>
            <p>
                You have vehicles that you upgrade through the game. You have
                levels on all kinds of environments. You even have
                cyberpunk-like (not the game) levels, that are just awesome.
            </p>
            <p>You even fight CROCS! (not the shoes)</p>
